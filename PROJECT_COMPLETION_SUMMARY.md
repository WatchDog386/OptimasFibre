## 💌 EMAIL TRANSFORMATION

### Example: Invoice Email

**BEFORE (Unprofessional):**
```
INVOICE FROM OPTIMAS FIBER

Dear Customer,

Invoice: INV-0001
Amount: Ksh 0
Status: Sent
PDF attached.
Payment: M-Pesa Paybill 123456 or Bank Transfer.
Contact: support@... | +254...

[Multiple paragraphs of payment details...]
[Banking information section...]
[Thank you message...]
[Automated email disclaimer...]
```

**AFTER (Professional):**
```
Dear Customer,

Your Invoice #INV-0001 is attached below.

📎 PDF Attached

OPTIMAS FIBER
```

### Why This is Better
- ✅ **Clear message** - Purpose is obvious
- ✅ **Professional** - Clean, minimal design
- ✅ **Scannable** - Takes 5 seconds to read
- ✅ **Focused** - PDF is the star
